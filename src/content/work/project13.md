description: |
  Port 25 up does not mean email delivered. In this project I built an end-to-end monitoring loop in Checkmk that validates both internal and external mail delivery - ensuring continuity across SMTP, IMAP, DNS, SPF/DKIM/DMARC, and real-world inbox reachability.

## Background

We often monitor servers, disks, and HTTP - but **email is quietly critical**.
And uptime of `smtp.service.local:25` does not guarantee continuity. Issues can hide in the middle:

- DNS or RBL problems
- Misaligned SPF/DKIM/DMARC
- Delivery to spam instead of inbox
- External relays silently dropping

My goal: a monitoring loop in Checkmk that validates **true inbox delivery**, both **internal** and **external**.

## Goal

**Build a Checkmk Email Roundtrip check that:**
- Confirms my **local MTA + IMAP pipeline** is functional (internal loop).
- Confirms **external continuity**: outbound MTA - relay (Amazon SES) - Gmail - IMAP fetch.
- Detects failures in DNS, auth, deliverability.
- Provides latency metrics (OK, Warn, Critical).

## The Design

### Internal Loop
- **Send:** SMTP server - internal monitoring mailbox (e.g. `loop-internal@example.local`)
- **Receive:** IMAP from local mail server
- **Use case:** Detects local outages quickly (queue stuck, Dovecot down, etc.).

### External Loop
- **Send:** SMTP (587/TLS) on my outbound MTA (via SES relay).
- **Destination:** a sentinel inbox (`sentinel-account@gmail.com`)
- **Receive:** Gmail IMAP (`imap.gmail.com:993`) using an App Password.
- **Use case:** Detects reputation/auth/SPF/DMARC issues, external downtime, spam filtering.

Together the loops distinguish:
- Internal ok + external fail = deliverability issue
- Internal fail + external ok = local infra issue
- Both fail = total outage

## Subject Matching

Checkmk appends tracking tokens to roundtrip subjects.
Example received subject:

```
[CHECKMK-ROUNDTRIP] site01/mail.example.net 1757421012 372
```

If you configure a fixed subject (`[CHECKMK-ROUNDTRIP] site01/mail.example.net`) the check **never matches** and you get "waiting for mails."

**Fix = Regex subject:**

```regex
^\[CHECKMK-ROUNDTRIP\] site01/mail\.example\.net.*
```

This matches the prefix while ignoring tokens.
Result: mails are properly recognized, queues drain, and you get real latency output.

## Implementation

### Rule Configuration (Checkmk 2.3+)

- **SMTP server:** `smtp.example.net:587` (TLS)
- **SMTP auth user:** `monitor-sender@example.net`
- **From:** `monitor-sender@example.net`
- **To:** `sentinel-account@gmail.com` (Gmail App Password required)
- **IMAP server:** `imap.gmail.com:993` (TLS)
- **IMAP user:** `sentinel-account@gmail.com`
- **Folder:** `INBOX`
- **Subject (regex):**
  ```
  ^\[CHECKMK-ROUNDTRIP\] site01/mail\.example\.net.*
  ```
- **Delete processed messages:** enabled

### Debugging
- Run manually with `./check_mail_loop --debug ...` from `~/lib/nagios/plugins`.
- Status file stored at:
  ```
  ~/var/check_mk/check_mail_loop.<suffix>.status
  ```
- Test IMAP manually with OpenSSL:
  ```bash
  openssl s_client -crlf -connect imap.gmail.com:993
  ```

## Results

- **Internal loop latency:** ~1s
- **External (SES to Gmail):** ~2-3s average
- **Check output:**
  ```
  OK - Received 4 mails, average delay 2.4s, age of last mail 32s
  ```
- **SES cost:** ~$0.90/month (9k mails at $0.10 per 1,000).

The monitoring continuously validates not only "SMTP OK" but **"mail actually trusted and delivered into Inbox."**

## Why Gmail?

- Strictest enforcement of SPF/DKIM/DMARC - if Gmail accepts you, most will.
- Free mailbox with IMAP access.
- Low probe cadence (every 5 minutes) is safe and unproblematic.

Alternative: pair with Outlook.com or mailbox.org for a neutral second sentinel.

## What I Learned

- Internal-only monitoring misses external failures.
- Regex subject matching is required in production.
- SES pricing is negligible at monitoring scale.
- Gmail as a sentinel is unusual, but effective for real-world assurance.

## Closing Notes

Monitoring CPU and RAM is easy.
**Monitoring trust is harder - but more important.**

With a simple Checkmk loop, I can see instantly if email continuity breaks.
From certificates to mail relays, awareness of delivery = continuity preserved.
