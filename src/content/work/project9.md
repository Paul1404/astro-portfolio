## How to Set Up Palo Alto ECMP for Dual WAN: The Complete, Real-World Guide (With Troubleshooting and Lessons Learned)

**Want to use both of your internet connections for true load balancing and failover on a Palo Alto firewall?**  
This guide walks you through the entire process of configuring ECMP (Equal-Cost Multi-Path) for dual WAN, explains the settings that actually matter, and shows you how to avoid the most common pitfalls—based on real-world experience and best practices.

---

### What is ECMP and Why Use It on Palo Alto?

**ECMP (Equal-Cost Multi-Path)** allows your Palo Alto firewall to use multiple WAN links simultaneously for outbound traffic.  
This means:
- **Automatic failover** if one WAN goes down.
- **Load balancing** to maximize bandwidth and reliability.
- **No need for complex external routers or scripts.**

But: **If not configured correctly, ECMP can cause session drops, high packet loss, and frustrating troubleshooting.**  
Let’s make sure you get it right.

---

## Step 1: Configure Both WAN Interfaces and Default Routes

**First, set up both WAN interfaces** (e.g., `ethernet1/1` and `ethernet1/2`) with their respective IP addresses and assign them to the correct security zone (commonly `Outside-Zone`).

**Add two default routes** in your Virtual Router, each pointing to a different WAN gateway, with the same metric.  
This is what enables ECMP to work.

**Example:**

| Destination | Next Hop      | Interface     | Metric |
|-------------|--------------|--------------|--------|
| 0.0.0.0/0   | 203.0.113.1  | ethernet1/1  | 10     |
| 0.0.0.0/0   | 198.51.100.1 | ethernet1/2  | 10     |

**CLI Example:**
```shell
set network virtual-router VRouter routing-table ip static-route WAN1-Default destination 0.0.0.0/0 nexthop ip-address 203.0.113.1 interface ethernet1/1 metric 10
set network virtual-router VRouter routing-table ip static-route WAN2-Default destination 0.0.0.0/0 nexthop ip-address 198.51.100.1 interface ethernet1/2 metric 10
commit
```
*(These are [RFC 5737](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5737) documentation IPs.)*

## Step 2: Enable ECMP in the Virtual Router

Go to **Network > Virtual Routers > [Your VR] > ECMP**.

- **Check “Enable”** to turn on ECMP.
- **Set Max Path** to 2 (or more if you have more WANs).
- **Choose a Load Balance Method** (see below).

---

## Step 3: The Critical Setting—Enable Symmetric Return

**Symmetric Return** is the setting that makes or breaks ECMP on Palo Alto.

- **What it does:** Ensures that return traffic for a session leaves via the same WAN interface it arrived on.
- **Why it matters:** Without it, you get asymmetric routing, which causes session drops and high packet loss (especially for TCP and ICMP).

**How to enable:**
- In the ECMP settings, **check “Symmetric Return”**.
- Commit your changes.

## Step 4: Choose the Right ECMP Load Balancing Method

Palo Alto offers several ECMP load balancing methods. Here’s what matters:

- **Weighted Round Robin:**  
  - Distributes sessions based on interface weights.
  - Good for links with different speeds, but can still cause session split/loss if not combined with Symmetric Return.

- **IP Hash:**  
  - **Best for most real-world setups.**
  - Ensures all sessions between a given client and server use the same WAN.
  - Great for sticky sessions and loss-free pings.

- **Balanced Round Robin:**  
  - Evenly distributes sessions, but less “sticky” than IP Hash.

**What worked best in my lab:**  
- **Method:** IP Hash  
- **Symmetric Return:** Enabled  
- **Hash Options:** Default (no extra boxes checked)

## Step 5: NAT Rules—Don’t Forget the Firewall’s Own Traffic

**NAT rules must include all internal zones and the firewall’s own zone (`Outside-Zone`) as source zones.**  
Otherwise, pings or updates from the firewall itself may not be NATed and will fail.

**Example NAT Rule:**
| Source Zone         | Destination Zone | To Interface   | Source Translation         |
|---------------------|------------------|---------------|---------------------------|
| Internal, WLAN, Outside-Zone | Outside-Zone     | ethernet1/1 or ethernet1/2 | Dynamic IP and Port (interface address) |

---

## Step 6: Test and Troubleshoot

### **A. Test from the Firewall**

```shell
ping source 203.0.113.2 host 8.8.8.8
ping source 198.51.100.2 host 8.8.8.8
```
- **Expected:** 0% packet loss on both WANs.

### **B. Test from a Client**

- **Ping and traceroute:**  
  ```shell
  ping 8.8.8.8
  traceroute 8.8.8.8
  ```
- **Check public IP:**  
  Visit [ifconfig.me](https://ifconfig.me) to see which WAN is used.

### **C. If You See Packet Loss or Session Drops:**

- **Double-check Symmetric Return is enabled.**
- **Clear the session table:**  
  ```shell
  clear session all
  ```
- **Test with only one WAN active:**  
  If loss disappears, the issue is ECMP-related.
- **Try switching to IP Hash** if using another method.

---

## Real-World Output

```plaintext
PING 8.8.8.8 from 203.0.113.2: 0% packet loss
PING 8.8.8.8 from 198.51.100.2: 0% packet loss
Client pings: 0% packet loss, stable downloads
```

## Lessons Learned (and What Actually Matters)

- **Symmetric Return is essential** for ECMP. Without it, expect session drops and high loss.
- **IP Hash is the most reliable method** for sticky, loss-free sessions.
- **Clear the session table** after changing ECMP settings.
- **NAT rules must cover all zones**—including the firewall’s own traffic.
- **Test with both firewall and client traffic** to catch all issues.
- **Disabling one WAN should result in zero loss**—if not, check your NAT and ECMP settings.

---

## Why This Works

- **Symmetric Return** keeps session state correct, even with multiple WANs.
- **IP Hash** ensures session stickiness, so no session is split between WANs.
- **Proper NAT rules** guarantee all traffic is translated and routed correctly.
- **You get real, production-grade multi-WAN with true failover and load balancing.**
