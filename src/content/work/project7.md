## Palo Alto PA-820 Home Lab: Real-World Configuration and Monitoring Examples

If you‚Äôre running a **Palo Alto PA-820 firewall at home** or in a lab, it‚Äôs crucial to understand how to check your configuration, monitor system health, and verify security policies. Here‚Äôs a practical guide with **real CLI output and explanations**‚Äîperfect for troubleshooting, learning, or planning your own setup.

---

### 1. System Information: Check Device Health and Uptime

Use this command to get a quick overview of your firewall‚Äôs status:

```sh
show system info
```

**Sample output:**
```plaintext
hostname: hldca-pa-gateway-1782
model: PA-820
sw-version: 11.0.4-h2
uptime: 55 days, 21:26:40
ip-address: 192.168.178.2
default-gateway: 192.168.178.1
```

**Key facts:**
- **Model & software version:** Ensure you‚Äôre running a supported PAN-OS.
- **Uptime:** Long uptimes indicate stability.
- **IP addressing:** Confirm management and gateway settings.

---

### 2. Interfaces and VLANs: See Your Network Segmentation

List all physical and logical interfaces, including VLANs and their zones:

```sh
show interface all
```

**Sample output:**
```plaintext
name                zone             address
----------------------------------------------------------
ethernet1/1         Outside-Zone     77.76.231.141/32
ethernet1/2.178     Internal-Zone    192.168.178.1/24
ethernet1/3.188     WLAN-Zone        192.168.188.1/24
ethernet1/4.199     Home-Zone        192.168.199.1/24
```

**Best practices:**
- Use **subinterfaces** for each VLAN.
- Assign each VLAN to a **security zone** for granular policy control.

---

### 3. Routing Table: Verify Network Reachability

Check your routing table to ensure all networks are reachable:

```sh
show routing route
```

**Sample output:**
```plaintext
destination         nexthop           interface
----------------------------------------------------------
0.0.0.0/0           185.245.22.62     ethernet1/1
192.168.178.0/24    192.168.178.1     ethernet1/2.178
192.168.188.0/24    192.168.188.1     ethernet1/3.188
192.168.199.0/24    192.168.199.1     ethernet1/4.199
```

**Tip:**
- The **default route (0.0.0.0/0)** should point to your ISP gateway.
- Each VLAN/subnet should have a direct route.

---

### 4. Security Policies: Review and Troubleshoot Access Rules

List your active security policies to see what‚Äôs allowed or denied:

```sh
show running security-policy
```

**Sample output:**
```plaintext
"Allow-Internal-to-WLAN-Home-Outside" {
    from Internal-Zone;
    source [192.168.188.0/24 192.168.199.0/24 192.168.178.0/24];
    to [Outside-Zone WLAN-Zone Home-Zone];
    action allow;
}
...
"vsys1+interzone-default" {
    from any;
    to any;
    action deny;
    type interzone;
}
```

**Best practices:**
- **Explicitly allow** only necessary traffic between zones.
- Use a **default deny** rule for interzone traffic.

---

### 5. NAT Policies: Confirm Internet Access

Check your NAT rules to ensure internal devices can reach the internet:

```sh
show running nat-policy
```

**Sample output:**
```plaintext
"Source-NAT-Outside" {
    from [ Internal-Zone WLAN-Zone Home-Zone ];
    source [ 192.168.188.0/24 192.168.199.0/24 192.168.178.0/24 ];
    to Outside-Zone;
    translate-to "src: ethernet1/1 77.76.231.141 (dynamic-ip-and-port)";
}
```

**Tip:**
- Use **dynamic IP and port NAT** for most home/lab setups.

---

### 6. Session Table: Monitor Live Traffic and Performance

See how many sessions your firewall is handling and its throughput:

```sh
show session info
```

**Sample output:**
```plaintext
Number of sessions supported:    131070
Number of allocated sessions:    1019
Active TCP sessions:             374
Active UDP sessions:             621
Throughput:                      99 Mbps
Packet rate:                     11,492/s
Session table utilization:       0%
```

**What to watch:**
- **Session utilization** should be well below the maximum.
- **Throughput** and **packet rate** help you spot bottlenecks.

---

### 7. System Resources: Check CPU and Memory Usage

Monitor resource usage to ensure your firewall isn‚Äôt overloaded:

```sh
show system resources
```

**Sample output:**
```plaintext
CPU:   52% user, 5.9% system, 42% idle
Memory: 5 GB total, 3.2 GB used, 368 MB free
Swap:  6 GB total, 84 MB used
```

**Tip:**
- High CPU or memory usage may indicate heavy traffic or a misconfiguration.

---

## Summary: Why These Checks Matter

- **Regularly checking these stats** helps you catch issues before they impact your network.
- **Clear segmentation and explicit policies** are key to a secure home lab.
- **Palo Alto‚Äôs CLI** gives you deep visibility‚Äîuse it!
